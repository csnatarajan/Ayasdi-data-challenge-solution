This is the solution for the Ayasdi data challenge that I received. It uses,

a)  Dlib (An excellent ML/data science library for C++).
b)  Trilinos (An excellent tool for computational modeling and comes with ~50 different packages to do pretty much anything under the sun).
c)  Intel MKL (for blas etc). 

Needless to say you might need a lot of libraries to compile. If you are interested, let me know and I will send the libs along.
