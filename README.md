This is the solution for the Ayasdi data challenge that I received. It uses,

1. [Dlib](http://dlib.net/)
* [Trilinos](http://trilinos.org/)
* [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl)


Needless to say you might need a lot of libraries to compile. If you are interested, let me know and I will send the libs along.
